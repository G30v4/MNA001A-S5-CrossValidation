# Cross Validation & Grid Search
Example of implementation of the Cross Validation and Grid Search algorithm

## Implementations

- [x] CrossValidator class
  - [x] getFolds method
  - [x] crossValidate method 
- [x] GridSearch Algorithm

## Activities
- [x] Evaluate the RandomForestClassifi classifier with our own CrossValidator class
- [x] Compare our CrossValidator algorithm with the one offered by the scikit-learn library
- [x] Finding the best parameters for the RandomForest classifier with the GridSearch algorithm
- [x] Compare the results of our GridSearch algorithm with scikit-learn's GridSearch
